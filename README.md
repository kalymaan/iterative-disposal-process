# iterative-disposal-process
trying to work out Jordan Hess's iterative disposal processes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFirpfPi2Fo


### To whoever sees this, 
# I'm trying to work out this problem with python. the pertinent stuff on the video is from 0:00 to 5:52 

## [here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFirpfPi2Fo) .. 

# the notebook file in this repo has my attempt at finding solutions for n= 1-8 .

these are my solutions so far: 

- n = 1  :  solution = 0.0
- n = 2  :  solution = 0.125
- n = 3  :  solution = 0.09876543209876543
- n = 4  :  solution = 0.1662808641975309
- n = 5  :  solution = 0.13746712499999972
- n = 6  :  solution = 0.34321075000001716
- n = 7  :  solution = 0.27709711108874213
- n = 8  :  solution = 0.799610328432375

the solutions are incorrect at n>=6, so once more than 2 even numbers are introduced to the set. I'm trying to implement everything in native python first. 
(ignore the itertools usage, ill re implement soon)

see if you can see any glaring issues. i have a suspicion, its with my filter_repeated_evens function. but it may be after that too.


ok thanks bye
